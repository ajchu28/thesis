# MAAD Thesis Colloqium Project
Created for University of Chicago Media Arts and Design Thesis 2023

How can physical and virtual spaces combine to better visualize spatial data? In this project, I pair a web interface to view income data across three cities with 3D printings of this same data. Through combining the mediums, I leverage the ability of a physical 3D print to highlight key data frames, while utilizing the power of the web interface to display a more holistic picture of the data.
