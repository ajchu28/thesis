      <p>
        <br><br>
        On September 28, 2021, The University of Chicago instituted its Lyft Ride Program. Through LyftPass, university 
        students receive ten discounted rides per month, up to $15.00 per ride, as long as they originate and end within 
        Hyde Park. The original LyftPass discount ran from 9pm-4am on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. However, two
        weeks later, the eligible hours were extended to include 5pm-4am, seven days a week.
        <br><br>
        Among UChicago students, there is a common consensus that Lyft rides in Hyde Park have increased in price 
        over the past few years. The mile long ride back home from the Reg late at night used to cost no more than 
        $7 or $8, now, people have paid as much as $25. Inspired by these observations from UChicago students, I decided 
        to visualize the rideshare data from before and after the implementation of LyftPass. Using data from Chicago's 
        Open Data Portal, where information on all rideshare rides are recorded, I used the metric of cost per minute 
        (without tip) to compare the prices of rides throughout the Hyde Park area. It is worth noting that rideshares
        by brand—whether that is Uber, Lyft or another party—are all aggregated.
        <br><br>
        From November 2019—when the data set begins—through November 2021, the average ride cost in Hyde Park was $1.15 
        per minute. Looking at the data from November 2021 through the end of 2022, the average ride cost was $1.89 per 
        minute, a 63% increase. Over the same timeframe, the average cost of a ride across the entire city increased by 
        only 13% from $0.81 to $0.94.

        Looking at this data with more granularity, the increased cost during LyftPass hours becomes even more apparent. 
        Comparing Hyde Park ride data before and after the implementation of LyftPass, outside the hours of LyftPass 
        operation, that is from 4:00 am to 5pm, the cost per minute of a rideshare ride increased by 39.84%. However, 
        during the hours of operation, the cost per minute jumped by 88.67%, more than twice as much as the non-LyftPass 
        hours. Comparing these inflated prices to the rest of the city, the highest cost per minute ride is $2.73 at 
        11pm in Hyde Park—the second highest is $2.00 at 2am in the River North/Gold Coast area.

        While this data has not been statistically analyzed and no causation may be drawn between the Lyft Ride Program 
        and the increase in rideshare prices in Hyde Park, the data does seem to support student sentiment that the 
        prices of Lyfts have increased during their time at the school. While students remain largely unimpacted—with 
        the discount, a $20 Lyft is only $5—people within Hyde Park without access to LyftPass face much higher costs 
        compared to two years ago. While it is undoubtedly nice to have access to subsidized rides, the subsidies 
        seem to have heavily impacted the rideshare economy, to the detriment of local residents of Hyde Park.
